Question 01:What is JSX, and why is it used?
Answer:JSX is a syntax extension used in React that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript. It makes building user interfaces easier and more intuitive by combining markup and logic in one place, improving readability and maintainability. Although browsers cannot understand JSX directly, tools like Babel compile it into regular JavaScript that React can execute efficiently. JSX also supports embedding JavaScript expressions, enabling dynamic and interactive UI elements. Overall, JSX simplifies component-based development and helps create cleaner, faster, and more organized React applications.



Question 02:What is the difference between State and Props?
Answer:State and props in React both hold data, but they serve different purposes. Props are read-only values passed from a parent component to a child component, allowing data to flow in one direction and enabling components to be reusable and consistent. A component cannot modify its own props. State, on the other hand, is data that belongs to a specific component and can change over time based on user interactions or events. When state updates, the component re-renders to reflect those changes. In simple terms, props pass data into a component, while state manages data inside a component.
