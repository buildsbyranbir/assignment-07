Question 01:What is JSX, and why is it used?
Answer:JSX is a syntax extension used in React that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript. It makes building user interfaces easier and more intuitive by combining markup and logic in one place, improving readability and maintainability. Although browsers cannot understand JSX directly, tools like Babel compile it into regular JavaScript that React can execute efficiently. JSX also supports embedding JavaScript expressions, enabling dynamic and interactive UI elements. Overall, JSX simplifies component-based development and helps create cleaner, faster, and more organized React applications.
