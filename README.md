Question 01:What is JSX, and why is it used?
Answer:JSX is a syntax extension used in React that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript. It makes building user interfaces easier and more intuitive by combining markup and logic in one place, improving readability and maintainability. Although browsers cannot understand JSX directly, tools like Babel compile it into regular JavaScript that React can execute efficiently. JSX also supports embedding JavaScript expressions, enabling dynamic and interactive UI elements. Overall, JSX simplifies component-based development and helps create cleaner, faster, and more organized React applications.



Question 02:What is the difference between State and Props?
Answer:State and props in React both hold data, but they serve different purposes. Props are read-only values passed from a parent component to a child component, allowing data to flow in one direction and enabling components to be reusable and consistent. A component cannot modify its own props. State, on the other hand, is data that belongs to a specific component and can change over time based on user interactions or events. When state updates, the component re-renders to reflect those changes. In simple terms, props pass data into a component, while state manages data inside a component.


Question 03:What is the useState hook, and how does it work?
Answer:The useState hook in React is a built-in function that allows functional components to create and manage state. It works by returning an array with two values: the current state and a function to update that state. When you call the update function, React re-renders the component with the new state value. The hook is initialized with a default value, and every time the state changes, React ensures the UI updates automatically to reflect those changes. In simple terms, useState lets components remember values and re-render when those values change, making it essential for handling dynamic and interactive behavior in React applications.



Question 04:How can you share state between components in React?
Answer:State can be shared between components in React by lifting the state up to a common parent component. Instead of each component managing its own state, the shared state is stored in the parent, and the parent passes both the data and the update function to its child components through props. When a child updates the state, the parent re-renders, and all components that depend on that state update automatically. State can also be shared using React Context, which allows data to be passed deeply through the component tree without prop drilling. For large applications, global state management libraries such as Redux, Zustand, or Recoil are often used.




Question 05:How is event handling done in React?
Answer:Event handling in React is done using functions that respond to user actions, similar to JavaScript but with a few key differences. Instead of using traditional HTML event attributes, React uses camelCase event names like onClick or onChange, and event handlers are passed as functions, not strings. React also uses its own system called Synthetic Events, which wraps browser events to ensure consistent behavior across different browsers. When an event occurs, React calls the assigned function and updates the component if needed. This approach makes event handling more predictable, organized, and easier to manage within React’s component structure.
